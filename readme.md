Some work with AST.

unwrap.ps1 -> create a ps1 file for every function present in a psm1 file
add-help   -> create a comment based help for every ps1 file in a directory. Basic comment help. Add .PARAMETER for every parameter present in the param() block.

## addÂ§help: example for [string]param1
.PARAMETER param1
  param1 must be of type [string]
